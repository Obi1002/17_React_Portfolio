    "aboutme":"Through Columbia's Coding Bootcamp, I am learning the technical skills needed to succeed as a PM and seeking an environment that fosters growth. Although I have been in education, I often find myself utilizing the same tools to develop new programs or curriculum for my departments: I handle the planning and marketing of a program that usually stems from carefully analyzing the department's needs. This includes managing the program/product throughout the lifecycle, gathering and prioritizing the program/product and target audience requirements, defining the vision, and working closely with multiple departments to deliver a successful program/product. This Bootcamp is well-versed, challenging and is allowing me to complete projects in different capacities. I look forward to opportunities that will enable this visionary to translate her skills from Higher Ed to a new industry. I welcome feedback and opportunities!",
